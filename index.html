                    <p class="p1 pA" > The challenging part is when you have to turn off the lights and run faster than Usain, so the demon monster won't catch you and eat you up for breakfast in hell, but we all know that whatever happens we still make it to our bed for sleep, in fact, we are more proud of ourselves than ever for some reason and make it through the whole night.</p>

                <p class="p2 pA">Well, for me though, it's different. I died in a puddle, and as I woke up, it's like... I soaked up all the water in the ocean and now it's coming out of every single pore of mine, as expected I also took some breath walked the living room to the kitchen like a thug who just got out of jail. But. As I reached that place where people usually feel tired just looking at dishes in it.</p>
                <p class="p2 pA" > I... saw You sitting in the corner of this filthy kitchen scared and as a punk I was(maybe more than me). I took the guts and approached you while my bladder was bursting of freight that; what if you are a witch. All it took was a touch of the atom of my hand to you, and BOOM, that scared little girl(not little at all) wasn't actually scared at all; she was just eating some nuts.</p>
                <p class="p2 pA" > I thought you were grinding human bones with your teeth, I guess I was really "nuts" at that time. I talked but said to myself "Stay within your limits, don't talk too much, keep that beak of your shut". Well, it turns out you were and still are thrice as talkative as I am. I feel puny. </p>

As every night dusks because of the dawn, the time came when I knew your bitter truth that I was willing to accept, but it turns out, you were not. Truth unfolded, lies enlightened, the feeling and words darkened, and the time came when I had to get out of the kitchen and towards my bed were lies my reality with me. </p>
                <p class="p3 pA maroonF"> I was scared but not scared of the monster, but... Afraid of loosing grip of your majestic hand; smoother than the butter on the kitchen self, you know I have a lot of chains bounded to me that I never asked for but, this time, I wish God would chain me just once more, chain me to you...</p>
